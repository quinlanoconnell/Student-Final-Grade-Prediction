# Student Final Grade Prediction Project

**Goal:** Predict a student's course grade based on a variety of factors, including predictors like parent's occupation, past failures, and other socioeconomic factors. Note: grade prediction is on a scale of 0-20, based on the system used in Portuguese schools. 0-9 indicates a failed course.

**Data Context:** Dataset is from Kaggle. Data cleaning and engineering were done to make predictions easier. Training/Test split used was 80/20. Analysis was conducted using Python.

**Content Summary:**
- Conducted Data Cleaning / Engineering / EDA
- Evaluated Performance of Models
- Analyzed Additional Effects of Specific Predictors

**Models Used:**
- Single Tree
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Bagging
- Boosting
